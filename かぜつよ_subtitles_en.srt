2
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:23,179
Ah but I think it’s..,

3
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:28,149
wait.

4
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,000
For now,

5
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:32,008
for,

6
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,697
for,

7
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:39,499
for now I will tweet.

9
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,299
Long time no see.

10
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:04,658
Ah but it’s bright. 

11
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:07,978
I think that is better.

12
00:01:17,659  --> 00:01:40,719
I rewatched the live streaming of last time, and the screen was foggy. I was thinking why it is like that, and I think it was my finger that put a fingerprint on the screen. So it was my fingerprint.

19
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,849
Today we can see it well.

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:02:02,729
Everybody, thank you for sending me your requests for songs. Some that you send to me this morning, I’m not able to cover because I couldn’t practice.

27
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:08,000
There are some people that send it to me earlier,

00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:12,000
and there are some that I can’t sing. 

00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:28,457
I’m going to sing a few of these, and the songs that I couldn’t cover, I am thinking to do it next week.
 
35
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:52,860
These days I want to let my bangs grow. I tried to put my bangs up, but here. Here is long. Here is long but it fits.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:17,659
Yeah, but, you requested a lot of songs that I already sang in streams before, so I can sing it.

56
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:32,369
What am I going to sing first. “Yonaderumenou” is high so I'm going to get used to high notes.

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02.000
It is Menou.

00:07:02.001 --> 00:07:06.000
I ate Ryukakusan (mint candy). 

00:07:06.001 --> 00:07:27,000
But I realised that when I eat Ryukakusan, my natural voice is better, but I can’t sing high notes.

101
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:31,608
But it is also my vocalization problem. 

111
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,140
Wait a little bit.

112
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:57,150
Hunter Walker san. Thank you for super chat. Thank you. “It’s beautiful” Thank you.

117
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:15,830
We don’t say “Time” in tag games? Like Time.

120
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:45,828
Hiroshi san, “Thank you for Yonaderu menou” Thank you for super chat.

122
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:58,459
Thank you. I’m going to sing Makaroni enpitsu.

127
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:13,108
It is a little bit low. It is low but I’m going to sing it with one key higher.

175
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,470
It is Makaen’s “Nandemonaiyo”

177
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:19,278
Good morning. Good morning.

179
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:31,809
Shelly is Ozaki Yutaka’s Shelly? I just know the chorus.

187
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:35,168
Time! It is Time!

191
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:54,510
I’m going to sing “Outsider” 

196
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,499
Ok I’m doing it. I am going to sing it with one key higher.

221
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,517
It is “outsider” from Eve san.

223
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:47,348
“My Rikako’s image is Eve” Maybe from Dramaturgy?

226
00:15:51,919 --> 00:16:22,509
“Is it already spring in Japan?” It was warmer one time, so I thought spring had come but it’s still winter. Like winter and spring. Winter. Spring. Middle. Between. Here.

237
00:16:55,409 --> 00:17:15,349
It is still cold. Cold. Especially today’s wind is cold. Last week’s live stream was a little bit cold, and it was the title of the stream. Yes it is cold. Outside is cold.

245
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:36,940
I thought that it was warm one time, and I changed my coat to a thin coat, like the one that I put in autumn and spring. Now, I can only go outside with a down jacket because it is so cold.

252
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,538
John Eric san “Hola.” Hola. Thank you for Super chat.

254
00:17:51,789 --> 00:17:58,210
“How much cold is it?” Cold enough to need to wear a down jacket. It is not fun.

256
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:05,047
“Can you make a spring related song” Tom san. Thank you for Super chat. Thank you. 

258
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,719
Make a song related to spring… 

259
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,047
Make a song? Hmm… 

260
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,829
Relates to spring.

261
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,129
I have to use my imagination. Hmmm…

262
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,840
Doing hanami (cherry blossom viewing)? Hanami. 

263
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:28,328
I never did hanami, but I have an image.

266
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:35,058
Regarding cherry blossom viewing, I have this image of a caterpillar potentially falling, I wonder about that.

269
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,108
In my recollection, have I ever done hanami. No. no, not in my recollection. 

271
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:47,848
Even I had, I forget things right away. 

273
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:49,578
This is misleading.

274
00:18:49,579 --> 00:18:52,239
How do we say it.

275
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,637
It is not a very old recollection.

277
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:03,397
Not in my recollection but in my memory. My memory, I want to remember it,

279
00:19:03,398 --> 00:19:06,478
but I forget it.

280
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:17,578
John Eric san. 「Arigato.」Arigato for the arigato super chat. Thank you.

283
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:25,419
Are there Caterpillars in spring? I have an image of that. 

286
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:33,268
Long time ago, I tasted the nectar of cherry blossom petals, and I was sipping it without thinking.

288
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:35,669
It was bad and bitter.

289
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,608
Is there poison in the petals of cherry blossoms?

290
00:19:38,609 --> 00:19:41,118
No?

291
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:48,339
It was very bitter. I thought that it would be sweet like azalea.

294
00:19:48,849 --> 00:19:55,079
It’s sad. The appearance looks so yummy though, like sakura mochi.

296
00:19:57,339 --> 00:20:02,459
Sakura mochi have a sweet image, so I thought that it(sakura nectar) would be tasty. 

299
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:09,829
Pocket change san. Thank you for super chat. Today’s wind is strong. 

303
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:17,258
Azalea have poison. But I was sipping it a lot.

304
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,679
Maybe in sweet nectar, there is some poison.

305
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,599
So maybe there is no poison in the cherry blossom because it is bitter.

306
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,829
Another one

307
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:43,820
from request.

308
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,008
It is Aimer.

309
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:58,250
Ah, yes, last time, I was talking in the live streaming about going to buy some crepe,

313
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,147
but after the stream,

314
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:04,548
the weather was bad,

315
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:09,670
and in the end I couldn’t go out. It was raining.

317
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,880
I wanted to eat crepe.

318
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:35,100
I’m going to sing Calc from Jimmy Thumb.

388
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:36,759
It was Calc.

390
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,030
Time! Time!

399
00:26:48,230 --> 00:27:00,398
“Hello from Peru” Ok. Hello, thank you. Ok. 

407
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,749
I love to use time now.

408
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,499
Maybe I should change how to say it.

409
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:30,098
Wait a little bit (old samurai japanese).  Wait a little bit. Wait.

416
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,709
I’m going to sing Koiwazurai.

442
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,289
It is Aimer’s Koiwazurai.

443
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,309
What I like from Aimer’s song?

444
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:24,649
The song that I like the most is probably Kataomoi.

446
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,029
That song is so lovely.

450
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:12,630
Someone said to me if  there are songs that I can sing of Haniwa (Honey Works), so I’m looking on Ufret for Haniwa.

455
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:23,590
There is Feat Hoshikawa Sara. Oh, it’s not only seiyuu (voice actor/actress). 

458
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:37,148
Ahh, maybe there aren’t songs that I know. Wait a little.

494
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,198
That song is “Kawaiku Naritai”.

496
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:25,388
I listened to it a lot when I was in high school.

499
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:56,077
Clubstar san. Thank you for super chat. Thank you.

501
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,700
“Well done”

503
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,369
AH!! Sorry I spoke too loud.

505
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:51,540
Recently I realized that my voice is lowest when I speak alone during my live streams. It is what I realized lately.

508
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:05,649
When I speak with people, we have to interact in real time.

511
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:22,107
Recently, I’ve noticed that the voice becomes louder and the intonation gets more strong/vigorous, according to the tension of the other party/person.

517
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:30,118
When I speak alone, … I’m talking to you, but in reality, I speak alone in front of a screen.

520
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:39,210
So it is like I don’t know. I’m alone. So I cool down.

523
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:52,009
So, someone requested me “Don’t look back in anger”, so I’m going to sing it. 

527
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:57,279
I am always bad at singing that song.

528
00:36:58,309 --> 00:37:02,329
Shape of you for example feels like a tongue twister for me so I can sing it quite a bit.

563
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:55,319
It was “Don’t look back in anger”. 

564
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:08,979
This one, when I sing it last time, my C accent was like “swi”, and I received a comment saying that it is better to say “sii”, so I tried.

568
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,718
I think that I improved since last time.

570
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,948
English is difficult.

571
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:29,920
“Cool” Thank you. Yes, Don’t look back in anger.

573
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,158
I want to sing Shape of you now.

574
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:41,509
I want to sing it cool.

670
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:48,590
It is Shape of you.

677
00:45:29,998 --> 00:45:31,678
Hmmm, western music.

678
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:39,759
I can sing Shape of you, not like the accent

680
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:50,248
but from a Japanese person’s perspective doesn’t it sound like a tongue twister? I am happy that I became able to comfortably sing Shape of you in an articulate way. 

684
00:45:53,210 --> 00:46:01,628
Chiao san, “Ieiri reo Silly Please.’’ Can I sing just the chorus? Thank you for super chat.

688
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,270
I think that I just know the chorus.

689
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:27,848
There are only 3 lines for the chorus. Sorry. Chorus chorus 3 lines.

709
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:16,269
Sorry, only that, only chorus. Sorry sorry.

712
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:44,639
“Listen to Chill beans, it is a cool girls band” Girls band, ok. I’ll take note.

721
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,229
The song was called Paper Hearts,

722
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:20,698
and there were a lot of people who covered it. From whom do I listen to it?

725
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:31,949
JUNGKOOK san covered it and other people too so I learned it. 

729
00:48:33,469 --> 00:48:39,650
It is difficult and low. Is it really capo 3?

806
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:17,357
The A melody was difficult. Paper Hearts.

808
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:41,860
And there is another request, Meru.

893
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,478
It was Meru from n-buna san.

896
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:30,259
Ok so to finish, I saw the comment “Kinmokusei no yoru” so I’m going to sing it.

899
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:33,328
I like that song too.

900
00:57:33,329 --> 00:57:35,809
It is very nice.

901
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:40,669
It feels a little bit nostalgic.

902
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,920
Ok so it is the last song.

987
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,209
It was “Kinmokusei no yoru”.

988
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:16,538
That sound was from there.

989
01:02:16,539 --> 01:02:23,889
The cloth was drying and maybe it fell. Since the wind is too strong.

999
01:02:56,690 --> 01:03:00,018
So I think that I’m going to finish the stream. 

1000
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:16,578
Today there are some songs that I couldn’t sing, and songs that I didn’t practice, so I’m going to try to practice to sing it next week and in 2 weeks.

1005
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,189
Nekopon san thank you for superchat.

1006
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:24,029
Let’s meet again!

1007
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:28,459
Today I have to go shopping, but the wind is strong so I don’t want to.

1009
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:30,348
Kanau san “Thank you for the stream” Thank you.

1010
01:03:30,349 --> 01:03:36,549
Thank you for coming to my live stream.
